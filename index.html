                        <h2>Background</h2>
                        <pThe World Happiness Report attempts to find a standardized measure of Happiness in different countries around the globe. Published by the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network, the report looks at a variety of explanatory factors, to create an individual score for each country. The report is created every year by a group of independent experts, however not every country is polled every year.</p>
                        <h2>Purpose</h2>
                        <p>While the data contained within the World Happiness Report covers a wide variety of valuable topics, the data is difficult to absorb without proper visualization. In order to better understand the data, there are a variety of key factors that one should attempt to visualize. One of these key visualizations is a geographic representation of the overall happiness score allowing the ability to see if happiness is concentrated in certain geographic regions. The visualizations should also break the data down into its component pieces and allow one to compare the different countries included. Finally, the visualizations should allow the user to see how these factors join together to create each countries happiness score, helping to identify which factors are the true primary drivers and which have little overall impact.</p>
                        <h2>Goals</h2>
                        <p>With this in mind, this project aims to create three specific visualizations for this data. First, a multi-axis scatterplot will be developed with the y-axis being the Happiness Score, and the x-axis changing based on the selection of each of the six explanatory factors. Each circle on the chart will represent a country, and tooltips will be included to specify the x & y values for each data point. In addition to this chart, a stacked bar graph will also be created. Each country will have its own bar, and that bar will be divided based on how much of an impact each explanatory factor has on the final score. These values add up to the Happiness Score for each country. The chart is able to be filtered by geographic region to compare smaller subsets of the data. Finally, a choropleth will be created to allow visualization across the world map. Each country that is included in the report will be filled with a scaling color based on the countryâ€™s Happiness Score. While the first two charts, only look at data from 2021, the choropleth will have a dropdown that allows for viewing the map of each report, from 2005 to the present. With these three visualizations the user will be able to gain a greater understanding of the data and be able to more readily draw conclusions about it.</p>
